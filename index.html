          <h2>LazerBrick</h2>
          <p>LEGO has always been a fascination of mine. I find the building process to be a stress-relieving and enjoyable creative outlet. I remember going to the store with my Grandmother when I was younger and getting to pick my favorite sets out. Eventually, those sets fell apart and I ran out of money, leading me to build my own creations with what I had on hand. At the start of 2024, I made an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lazerbrick/">Instagram Page</a> to share my MOCs (M.y O.wn C.reation). Here are some of the photos I took:</p>
          <br><p>I encourage others to make their own MOCs because:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>They can make for good display pieces</li>
            <li>It can be stress relieving           </li>
            <li>It can be a form of expression       </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Heart</h2>
          <p>Built with pieces on-hand that looked more organic. I then added sharper elements to resemble branching-out vessels. I used three light sources this time, which added some extra challenge to light diffusal.</p>

          <p>For this MOC, I followed the prompt: industrial abstract. I put a lot of emotion into the building process, which made it feel more natural and less calculated. Asymmetrical balance was another focus.</p>
